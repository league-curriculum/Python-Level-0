# Python Level 0 Curriculum

## Installing Tools

The easiest way to update the curriculum is to create a Codespace from this repo. Click the green "Code" button, then select the "Codespaces tab"

See these wiki pages for installing a new repository locally:

* Install lesson builder
** [For general use](https://github.com/league-curriculum/Python-Level-0/wiki/Install-For-General-Use)
** [For development](https://github.com/league-curriculum/Python-Level-0/wiki/Install-Development-Versions)
* [Install vuepress](https://github.com/league-curriculum/Python-Level-0/wiki/Install-Vuepress-and-Yarn)

## Using Lesson Builder

Below is a cheatsheet. See the[wiki for full documentation](https://github.com/league-curriculum/Python-Level-0/wiki/Using-Lesson--Builder)

To build the website:

```bash
jtl -vv build 
```

To run a development server

```bash
jtl serve
```

Now you can view the website on your local machine at http://localhost:8080/Python-Level-0/. If you are running in Codespace, go to the
`PORTS` tab in the bottom panel and click on the globe icon for port 8080.
