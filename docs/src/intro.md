# Python With Turtles

The first thing to do before we get started is to visit [Trinket.io]
(https://trinket.io) to create an account. Having a Trinket accoun will allow
you to save your lessons as we go along and show them to friends and
family. 

You'll see lots of new things during this tutorial.  Code may always look
unfamiliar, and *no one knows everything* about code, not even the experts!
So the most important thing is to **keep going**, even if you're confused or
run into errors!

Also, for each of the interactive examples you see, there is a **Reset**
button in the left hand menu.  If you want to start over, it will reset your
code back to the beginning.

Have fun!
