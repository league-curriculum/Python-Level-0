# Python With Turtles

The first thing to do before we get started is to visit [Trinket.io](https://trinket.io) to create an account. Having a Trinket account will allow
you to save your lessons as we go along and show them to friends and
family. 

<span style="background-color: green; padding: 10px 24px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-right: 10px;">

You'll see lots of new things during this tutorial.  Code may always look
unfamiliar, and *no one knows everything* about code, not even the experts!
So the most important thing is to **keep going**, even if you're confused or
run into errors!

Also, for each of the interactive examples you see, there is a **Reset**
button in the left hand menu.  If you want to start over, it will reset your
code back to the beginning.

Have fun!
