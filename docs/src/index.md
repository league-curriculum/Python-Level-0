This course will teach you the basics of a programming language named Python.
Python is fun to learn but is also a **Real** programming language that
powers websites and apps like Yelp.com and Twitter.

[The LEAGUE of Amazing Programmers ](https://jointheleague.org) is a non profit progamming school that teaches 5th through 12th grade students all over San Diego to program. We are really happy to have you here for this class, and we hope that you will love programming as much as we do. 

This Hour of code activity was originally created by Trinket.io, and this course is 
a modified version of [A Visual Introduction to Python](https://hourofpython.com/a-visual-introduction-to-python/), with some extra lessons and exercises.
