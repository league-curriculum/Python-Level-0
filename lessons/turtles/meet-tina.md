# Meet Tina 

Tina is a Turtle that you control with code.  Press run to see what this program does, and see if you can figure out what line tells Tina to say,`"Why, hello there!"`

```python.run
import turtle
tina = turtle.Turtle()
tina.shape('turtle')

tina.penup()
tina.forward(20)
tina.write("Why, hello there!")
tina.backward(20)
```

Don't worry if you don't understand all of the code.  You don't have to to get started, and more and more of it will become familiar to you as you keep going.
