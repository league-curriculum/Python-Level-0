# Make your turtle's shape 'turtle', .shape('turtle')

# Set your turtle's speed using .speed(2)

# Set your turtle's color using .color('green')

# Move your turtle forward using .forward(100)
# TEST    Did your turtle move forward?

# Move your turtle left or right using .left(90) 
# or .right(90)

# Now put the forward and left/right code into a for 
# loop to repeat 4 times.
# TEST    Did your turtle draw a square?

# Move your turtle to a new place on the screen using .goto(x, y)
# x=0 and y=0 is the center of the screen

# Have your turtle draw a circle using .circle(radius, steps=30)
# TEST    Did your turtle draw a circle?

# Add color to your shape by adding .begin_fill() 
# before drawing the circle
