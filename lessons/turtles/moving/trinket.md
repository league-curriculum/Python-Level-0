As we saw in the last example, Tina can move!  When she moves, she draws a line.  She can move `forward` and `backward` and turn `right` or `left` a certain number of degrees.

Run this example to see her move:
 
```python.run
import turtle
tina = turtle.Turtle()
tina.shape("turtle")

tina.forward(50)
tina.left(90)
tina.forward(50)
tina.left(90)
tina.forward(50)
```

She's almost made a square!  Can you help her complete it?  What other shapes can you help Tina draw?
