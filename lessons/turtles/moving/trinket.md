As we saw in the last example, Tina can move!  When she moves, she draws a line.  She can move `forward` and `backward` and turn `right` or `left` a certain number of degrees.

Run this example to see her move:
 
{{ trinket("moving_1.py", width="100%", height="800", embed_type="python") | safe }}

She's almost made a square!  Can you help her complete it?  What other shapes can you help Tina draw?
