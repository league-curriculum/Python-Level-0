# Happy Pet


Write functions to represent the activities that will make the user's pet happy.


```python.run:height=600

# TODO)
#   1. Ask the user to enter the type of pet they want (give them a few
#      choices).
#   2. Use a loop (maybe a while loop?) to keep offering interactions with
#      their pet until the desired pet happiness level has been reached.
#      Examples of activities are: Feed, Walk, Play
#   3. Write a function for each of the pet activities offered.
#      Each activity should increase (or decrease) the pet's happiness
#      level by a different amount, depending on the kind of pet they
#      have. For example, a fish might not enjoy a walk!
