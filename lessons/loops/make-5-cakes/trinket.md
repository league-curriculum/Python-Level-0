One of the great things about functions is that they can repeat complicated instructions without us having to repeat ourselves in code!

Earlier we talked about how **functions are like recipes**. In this exercise, we've already taught Tina the recipe for making a picture of a cake and she's made three.  Tell her to make more cakes by **calling** the function with different `x` and `y` locations at the very bottom of the program.  

How many cakes should she make?

{{ trinket("make-5-cakes_1.py", width="100%", height="500", embed_type="python") | safe }}

Hint: The first number in `make_cake()` is **how far left or right** Tina should go, while the second is **how high or low** she should go before starting to draw.

Run this program, then change the program how ever you want. Some things you can try: 
* Change the colors of the cakes
* Make the cakes bigger
* Put the cakes in different places
