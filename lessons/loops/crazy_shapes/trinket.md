# Shapes and Colors

Here is the program we created to make squares with loops. Try modifying this 
program to make other shapes. Try some of these things:

* Change the number of sides
* Change the angle the turtle turns ( the `left` variable )
  * Try numbers that are even sections of a cirle, like 60, 45, 90 or 40
  * Try numbers that aren't even seconds of a circle, like 172 or 43

Here are some more ideas for you. You can put a loop inside a loop! Try this
program. 

{{ trinket("nested_loops_1.py", width="100%", height="300", embed_type="python") | safe }}

Here is another crazy program: 

{{ trinket("nested_loops_2.py", width="100%", height="450", embed_type="python") | safe }}

Now try creating your own crazy progam. This time, you will start from an empty
file, so copy parts from other programs to get started.
