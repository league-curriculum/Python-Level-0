title: Repeating and Remembering
---

Next we are going to learn about two really important parts of programming:
repeating things with loops and remembering things with variables. 


Loops are a really important part of progams that let a program do something
more than once without writing the same code over and over. For instance, if we
wanted to print "Yea Tina!" three times, you could write:

```python 
print("Yea Tina!")
print("Yea Tina!")
print("Yea Tina!")
```

But, it would be much better to use a loop instead, which would look like this: 


```python 
for i in range(3):
    print("Yea Tina!")

```

Variables are like boxes we use to store numbers and words, so they are the memory of a program.  We could have variables to track how much fruit we have

```python
apples = 10
oranges = 6
```

Then use those names later to add all of our fruits together. 

```python 
print(apples+oranges)
16
```

Now lets learn how to use these new programming ideas in our programs.
