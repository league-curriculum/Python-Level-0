# Variables Loops and Lists


## Remembering with Variables

Variables are like boxes we use to store numbers and words, so they are the memory of a program.  We could have variables to track how much fruit we have

```python
apples = 10
oranges = 6
```

Then use those names later to add all of our fruits together. 

```python 
print(apples+oranges)
16
```

## Repeating with Loops


Loops are a really important part of progams that let a program do something
more than once without writing the same code over and over. For instance, if we
wanted to print "Yea Tina!" three times, you could write:

```python 
print("Yea Tina!")
print("Yea Tina!")
print("Yea Tina!")
```

But, it would be much better to use a loop instead, which would look like this: 


```python 
for i in range(3):
    print("Yea Tina!")

```


## Lists

List are a very important thing in programming, one of many _data structures_
that hold data. A list is a lot like a list that you know about, like a grocery list:

```
Things To Buy
  - apples
  - oranges
  - bread 
  - milk
```

But in Python, a list can hold a lot more than just names of grocery items. 



Now lets learn how to use these new programming ideas in our programs.
