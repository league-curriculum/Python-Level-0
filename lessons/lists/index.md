# Lists

List are a very important thing in programming, one of many _data structures_
that hold data. A list is a lot like a list that you know about, like a grocery list:

```
Things To Buy
  - apples
  - oranges
  - bread 
  - milk
```

But in Python, a list can hold a lot more than just names of grocery items.
