# Change me so range() has three numbers, 
# and try to figure out what the third
# number does. What happens if you make 
# some of the numbers negative?

# HINT: If the third number is negative, 
# the first number should be *bigger* than
# the second, but if the third number is positive, 
# it should be smaller.
